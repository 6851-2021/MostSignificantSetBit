# Most Significant Set Bit

This project implements several algorithms in C to compute the
**Most Significant Set Bit (MSSB)** of a binary number,
for 8-bit, 16-bit, 32-bit, and 64-bit words.
See [the writeup](write-up.org) for details.

## Usage

* To compile the code (on a 64-bit architecture), just run `make`.
* Then run `./main` to run all performance tests.
